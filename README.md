# daemonize
Simple script for turning commands into daemons.

I use this mainly to launch applications from the command line then detatching the application from the terminal.

# Execution
`./daemonize.sh <command>`

# Example
`./daemonize.sh postman`

# Alias
I like to set up an alias for my shell that allows me to just call `dpostman` and have it call the above example. Just for convience.
